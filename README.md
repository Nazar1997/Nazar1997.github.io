# Lab XYZ Website Repository

Welcome to the official GitHub repository for Lab XYZ's website. Here you'll find the code that powers our main site, allowing us to share our research, updates, and data with the public. 

## Project Overview

This repository contains the source code for our lab's website, which is primarily composed of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Our aim is to provide an open and interactive platform where we can share our latest research findings and the related data.

## Structure

This repository has the following structure:

- `/index.html`: The main HTML file for our website.
- `/css`: This directory contains all the CSS files.
- `/js`: This directory contains all JavaScript files.
- `/assets`: This directory contains other assets such as images and additional files.

## Data Hosting

Due to the large size of our data sets, they are not hosted directly on GitHub. The data is stored on [cloud service provider], and links to access the data are provided on the website.

## Local Setup 

To run our website locally, you'll need to:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone https://github.com/<username>/lab-xyz.git`.
2. Navigate to the cloned folder: `cd lab-xyz`.
3. Open `index.html` in your preferred browser.
