    <h2>Experience</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>ML researcher</strong> {Toloka ex-Yandex} | Nov 2022 - Pres.<br>
            I've successfully developed advanced crowdsourcing pipelines geared towards the fine-tuning of Large Language Models (LLMs). Furthermore, I've designed supplementary models, such as reward models that are instrumental in Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). In addition to this, I have contributed to the academic world by publishing papers and tutorials on prestigious conferences like NeurIPS, addressing critical subjects like LLM fine-tuning and strategies to overcome prevalent LLM challenges. Notably, I have also crafted effective pipelines for leveraging LLMs with crowdsourcing, resulting in a significant efficiency boost - reducing markup time by 20% and cost by 30%.
